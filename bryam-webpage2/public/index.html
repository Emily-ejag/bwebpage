          <p class="big-name"><strong>Bryam Xavier Astudillo Carpio </strong></p>
          <p class="major">Structural Engineering Ph.D. student at <br><span>Stanford University</span></p>
          <p class="about">Bryam Astudillo is a Graduate Research Assistant specializing in Structural Engineering at Stanford University. <br><br>
            With a strong focus on seismic performance and nonlinear modeling of structures, Astudillo is passionate about Performance-Based Earthquake Engineering and Seismic Resilience. His current research centers on advancing the design of high-performing structures using strongback frames and force-limiting connections.<br><br>
            He has gained valuable experience in numerical simulation and full-scale testing, including shake-table testing of a 4-story building at the E-Defense shake table in Japan. <br><br>
            Beyond engineering, Bryam enjoys programming, playing soccer, and spending time with family and friends.</p>
