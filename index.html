With a strong focus on seismic performance and nonlinear modeling of structures, Astudillo is passionate about Performance-Based Earthquake Engineering and Seismic Resilience. His current research centers on advancing the design of high-performing structures using strongback frames and force-limiting connections. He has gained valuable experience in numerical simulation and full-scale testing, including shake-table testing of a 4-story building at the E-Defense shake table in Japan.<br><br>Beyond engineering, Bryam enjoys programming, playing soccer, and spending time with family and friends.</p><div class="scroll-indicator"><p style="color:#dcdcdc">scroll down to learn more</p><img src="img/scroll-down.gif" alt="Scroll down"/></div></div></div></div><div class="scroll"><div class="slideshow-container"><div class="mySlides fade"><div class="time"><p class="year">2025</p><p>Mar.
